<h1>FRUGAL AI KILL SWITCH</h1>
<div class="subtitle">The First-Principles Playbook for Cutting 30–50% of Your AI Cloud Waste</div>
<p>By <strong>No 13th Floor</strong></p>
<h2>THE PROBLEM IN PLAIN NUMBERS</h2>
<p>The AI industry is in a reckless spending phase. Because the technology is moving fast, companies are throwing money at it without discipline — just to stay in the race.</p>
<p>Here's what that looks like in practice: A company uses GPT-4 for tasks a model 10x cheaper could handle. They train on datasets full of duplicates, noise, and irrelevant records. They run inference on oversized instances 24/7, even at 2am with zero traffic. They store embeddings, checkpoints, and logs they will never use again. Nobody has ever audited any of it.</p>
<p><strong>The result: 30–50% of most AI budgets is pure waste.</strong> Not inefficiency. Waste. Money going nowhere, producing nothing.</p>
<h2>THE 7 LEVERS</h2>
<h3>Lever 1: Right-Size Your Models</h3>
<p>Potential savings: 20–60% of inference costs. Most production tasks do not require frontier models. Switch to smaller models for simple tasks.</p>
<h3>Lever 2: Kill Idle Compute</h3>
<p>Potential savings: 15–35% of compute costs. Every GPU instance that is on but not working is money on fire. Auto-shutdown dev environments, scale-to-zero on idle endpoints.</p>
<h3>Lever 3: Clean Your Training Data</h3>
<p>Potential savings: 10–40% of training costs. Run deduplication on your training corpus. Remove low-quality records. Cleaner data trains faster, cheaper, and better.</p>
<h3>Lever 4: Cache Aggressively</h3>
<p>Potential savings: 10–30% of inference costs. Implement semantic caching. Cache hit rates of 30–50% eliminate that percentage of your inference bill.</p>
<h3>Lever 5: Batch Everything You Can</h3>
<p>Potential savings: 30–50% on eligible workloads. Real-time inference is 2–5x more expensive than batch. Move non-urgent tasks to batch APIs.</p>
<h3>Lever 6: Audit Your Storage</h3>
<p>Potential savings: 5–20% of infrastructure costs. Set retention policies. Delete unused embeddings. Turn off debug logs in production.</p>
<h3>Lever 7: Build a Cost Gate</h3>
<p>Prevent future waste. Set hard budget alerts. Add cost estimates to your CI/CD pipeline. Assign an AI cost owner per team.</p>
